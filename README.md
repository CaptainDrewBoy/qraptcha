# QRAPTCHA

The Quote Rhyming Automated Public Turing test to tell Cinephiles and Humans Apart, or QRAPTCHA, is a new kind of Turing Test.
The concept is simple: over decades upon decades of film, certain quotes have firmly embedded themselves into pop culture. The QRAPTCHA simply asks that you, a human who surely has the same cultural experiences as the developer, recognise and complete these quotes.
In order to make things a *teensy* bit harder for the machines that have now begun scraping said pop culture, we ask you to input a word that **rhymes** with the missing word.
For example, the quote "You're gonna need a bigger _" might appear. The missing word is "boat" (from Jaws) and so the user should input a word RHYMING with boat, such as "float" or "moat". Get two in a row to pass!
