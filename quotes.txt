May the *Force* be with you
There's no place like *home*
It's *alive*
*Life* is like a box of chocolates
I'll be *back*
You're gonna need a bigger *boat*
You can't handle the *truth*
*Bond*. James *Bond*
Where we're going, we don't need *roads*
To infinity and *beyond*
Keep your *friends* close, but your enemies closer
I see *dead* people
*Shaken*, not stirred
I feel the need, the need for *speed*
You either die a *hero* or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
Why so *serious*
With great *power* comes great responsibility
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a *damn*
I'm going to make him an offer he can't *refuse*
You *talking* to me?
E.T. *phone* home
I am *Iron* Man
Say *hello* to my little friend
